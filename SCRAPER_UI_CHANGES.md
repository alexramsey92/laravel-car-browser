## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Test It**: Go to `/admin/scrape` and try it out
2. **Check Logs**: Watch `/storage/logs/laravel.log` for activity
3. **Create Scrapers**: Use SCRAPER_GUIDE.md to build custom scrapers
4. **Customize**: Modify the UI to match your branding

## 📝 Notes

- The test scraper works immediately (returns 3 sample cars)
- Cars.com scraper is a template (needs CSS selector adjustment)
- All scrapers support dry run and save options
- Command line still works: `php artisan cars:scrape --test`
- Database updates only happen if "Save to DB" is enabled
- Dry run mode automatically disables database saving
