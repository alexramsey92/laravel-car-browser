- **Select All**: Check all available scrapers
- **Deselect All**: Uncheck all scrapers
- **View All Cars**: Navigate to car listing page

### Command Line (Still Available)
```bash
# Test scraper
php artisan cars:scrape --test

# Specific scraper
php artisan cars:scrape --source=cars.com

# Multiple scrapers
php artisan cars:scrape --source=test --source=cars.com

# List scrapers
php artisan cars:scrape --list

# Dry run
php artisan cars:scrape --test --no-save
```

## Form Data Handling

The updated controller handles:
- `sources[]` - Array of selected scraper sources
- `dry_run` - Boolean flag for preview mode
- `save_to_db` - Boolean flag to control database saving

## Next Steps

1. **Test the UI**: Go to `/admin/scrape` and try the different options
2. **Add More Scrapers**: Use `SCRAPER_GUIDE.md` to create custom scrapers
3. **Customize**: Modify CSS in the scrape.blade.php file to match your branding
4. **Monitor**: Check logs at `/storage/logs/laravel.log` for scraper activity

## Notes

- The test scraper works immediately without external dependencies
- Cars.com scraper is a template - CSS selectors need adjustment for current site structure
- All scrapers support the same options (dry run, database save, etc.)
- Results are displayed in a clean summary table
- Failed scrapers show error messages in the results
